<h3>Chicago Traffic Light Data Analysis</h3>

<b>Description:</b>

This repository contains a simple C++ program that I created to analyze traffic light data within the City of Chicago. For this project, I used C++ file streams to parse 
through .txt files from 2022-2023 in order to categorize traffic light cameras by location, intersection, and by unique ID. 

<b>Key Features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Able to select which data file you would like to access.</li>
  <li>Visual charts of peak violation months.</li>
  <li>Built in search for specific intersections.</li>
</ul>

<b>How to Get Started:</b>

Ensure that you have a C++ compiler (g++ or clang++) installed on your machine. Install or clone the repository. After, enter the following commands into your terminal:
```
g++ main.cpp uniqueCamera.cpp neighborhood.cpp cameraRecord.cpp
./a.exe
```
